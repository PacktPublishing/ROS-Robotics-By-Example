# ROS Robotics By Example
This is the code repository for [ROS Robotics By Example](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/ros-robotics-example?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781782175193), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Unity is one of the biggest game engines in the world, providing the user with a range of important tools that they need to bring their ideas into reality. Beginner game developers are optimistic, passionate, and ambitious, but that ambition can be dangerous! Too often, budding indie developers and hobbyists bite off more than they can chew. Games like Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, and Fruit Ninja are fun, simple games that have delighted players and delivered big profits to their creators. This is the perfect climate for new game developers to succeed by creating simple games with Unity, starting today.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<robot name="dd_robot">
 <!-- Base Link -->
 <link name="base_link">
 <visual>
 <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0" />
 <geometry>
 <box size="0.5 0.5 0.25"/>
 </geometry>
 </visual>
 </link>
</robot>
```

The format of this book is intended for you to follow along and perform the
instructions as the information is provided. You will need a computer with Ubuntu
14.04 (Trusty Tahr) installed. Other Ubuntu versions and Linux distributions
may work as well as Mac OS X, Android, and Windows but documentation for
these versions will need to reference the ROS wiki (http://wiki.ros.org/
Distributions).
The version of ROS that this book was written around is Indigo Igloo, which is the
current release recommended for stability. Its end of life is targeted for April 2019.
Other versions of ROS may be used but are untested.
All the software used in this book is open source and freely available for download
and use. Instructions to download the software are found in the chapter where the
software is introduced. In Chapter 1, Getting Started with ROS, instructions are given
to download and set up the ROS software environment.
Our preferred method to download software is the use of Debian packages. Where
no Debian packages exist, we refer to downloading the software from repositories
such as GitHub.
Gazebo simulation performs intensive graphics processing and the use of a dedicated
graphics card is advised but not required.
Peripheral devices such as 3D sensors, Xbox, or PS3 controllers, Arduino or
Raspberry Pi controller boards, and Android mobile devices are optional equipment.
